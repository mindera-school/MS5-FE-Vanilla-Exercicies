            <p>I must not fear.
                <br>
            Fear is the mind-killer.
            <br>
            Fear is the little-death that brings total obliteration.
            <br>
            I will face my fear.
            <br>
            I will permit it to pass over me and through me.
            <br>
            And when it has gone past I will turn the inner eye to see its path.
            <br>
            Where the fear has gone there will be nothing. Only I will remain.
            <br/>
